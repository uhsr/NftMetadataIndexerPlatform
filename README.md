# NftMetadataIndexerPlatform

## Description

An NFT marketplace backend built with Rust and CosmWasm, leveraging IBC for cross-chain asset transfers and offering customizable royalty enforcement through on-chain governance.

## Features

- Indexes NFT metadata from multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, Polygon, and Solana, using their respective RPC APIs.
- Stores NFT metadata in a PostgreSQL database with optimized indexing for fast querying by token ID, contract address, and metadata attributes.
- Implements a robust event listener that subscribes to blockchain events (e.g., Transfer, Mint) via WebSockets and triggers metadata indexing updates.
- Provides an API endpoint that supports GraphQL queries for flexible and efficient retrieval of NFT metadata and related information.
- Automatically refreshes NFT metadata by periodically fetching updated information from IPFS and decentralized storage solutions like Arweave.
- Integrates with image processing libraries (e.g., ImageMagick) to generate thumbnails and optimize images for display in the platform's user interface.
- Utilizes a caching layer (e.g., Redis) to minimize database load and improve API response times for frequently accessed NFT metadata.
- Implements rate limiting and authentication mechanisms to protect the API from abuse and unauthorized access.
